#Copying packages to text file
lets say you are working on another computer or another person wants to use the program,
first they will need to install the correct package version to get the system up and running,
so you can copy the package version that you used in your enviroment variables into a text file,
where then they can have access to that file and immediately install the correct package version,
to copy these package version into a text file run this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt  --> name of the text file that you created

After that a file will be created either send it to them or upload it on github then they can install the packages by
running this command: pip install -r requirements.txt
