First run this command in cmd: pip3 install virtualenvwrapper-win, if it gives you error then run this command: pip3 install --user virtualenvwrapper-win 
OR you can just reopen cmd as admin and run the first command again

Now you have installed the wrapper, now we are going to create an environment

#Create environment
Run this command in the cmd or terminal: mkvirtualenv test --> (Name_of_Environment)
After you run the command now your in test environment

#Create a directory with the same name as our virtual environment in our preferred development folder
Navigate to that place through the cmd, after you go there run this command: "setprojectdir ." dont include prentices
this will bind our virtualenv with our current working directory
Now anything you do in that directory will be add to the virtual environment

#Exist environment:
To exist from the environment you write deactivate

#Access environment:
To go back again inside the environment you run this command in terminal: name of the environment --> test\scripts\activate
OR workon test --> (Name_of_Environment)

#Existing environment
run this command to find all the created environment: lsvirtualenv

#Django version
run this to check version django-admin --version
